  content: |-
    <p>At Foliosus Web Design, we pride ourselves on building sites that fit our clients' needs. Bespoke software should fit your organization the way a good suit should fit you.</p>
    
    <p>We want to build websites that we can be proud of, and that our clients can be proud of as well. Our sites are good for their users, and good under the hood, too.</p>
    
    <h2>Our skills</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Branding:</strong> logo design, visual identity</li>
      <li><strong>Graphic design:</strong> not just for web pages, but print design as well (business cards, letterhead, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom web sites:</strong> your website, the way you want it</li>
      <li><strong>Custom applications:</strong> if your site is more than a marketing brochure, we can build it</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Our process</h2>
    
    <p>Typically, a new site or site redesign process will go through the following stages:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Investigation</h4>
        <p>This is the hardest phase for our clients; we ask lots of questions about who you are, who you want to be, and what your message is.  This is all information that will help us put together your branding or visual identity, or understand what your current branding is to apply to the new site.  We will also ask lots of questions about the content you anticipate having on your site.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Site planning</h4>
        <p>The site planning phase is quite fun; we will work together through multiple feedback cycles to put together a shared vision for the final product. This will involve wireframes, mockups, and lots of conversation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Site construction</h4>
        <p>For our clients, this phase is perhaps the most boring; they sit back while we take over the work, with occasional questions about important decisions that need to be made.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Site approval</h4>
        <p>This is where it all comes together: the client sees the first beta of the site.  Although we would love to deliver finished software, at this time, and really surprise our clients, realistically that isn't possible.  The clients need to click through the site and make that everything is ok; the text reads how they want, the applications behave how they want.  In this phase, we will go through as many feedback cycles as necessary until everyone is happy with the final product.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Launch!</h4>
        <p>Once final approval is granted, we will launch your site. this is the most exciting part of the process. If necessary, that will include submission to the top search engines for indexing, to help your site do well in search placement. This is where our clients let their clients and friends know that they have a new site.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
