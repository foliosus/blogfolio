    I just got a new 24" iMac, running the latest Leopard; I ran into this problem again while building the new system. This time, with the latest MySQL package (5.1.30), the following command worked:
    
    <pre class="code">sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql --with-mysql-config=`which mysql_config`</pre>
    
    This uses Igor's suggestion, but works better for the current MySQL package.

  body: Unfortunately, I have zero experience with NetBeans.  If OCI8 works from IRB, then all of the Ruby-level work is in place and so the problem must be with NetBeans.  If you've got a PPC-only NetBeans codebase, or something similar, that could be causing the problem; beyond that, I'm completely in the dark.

    It's true, calla lilies are an irritant.
    
    Most members of the Arum family (Araceae) are skin and eye irritants, and should never be eaten.  The family has a tendency to build up large amounts of calcium oxalate in its tissues, so much that it crystallizes.  These minute crystals are called raphides.  They tend to be quite pointy, so if you break up the plant tissue you get impaled with a bunch of tiny sharp things.  They're small enough that you can't really see them, but they're sharp enough to irritate skin, cause damage to eyes, and cause lots of pain to your mouth if you try eating them.
    
    Having said this, there is some evidence that the crystals aren't what cause the damage: <a href="http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=10056" title="Flora of North America" rel="nofollow">it might be proteolytic enzymes</a> and not raphides that cause the damage.

    Hi, all
    
    The only one thing, which actually works for me:
    
    
    sudo gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=`which mysql_config5`
    
    
    
    Thank you,

    Thanks, Brent. I was able to resolve the issue, and actually the fix turned out to be so simple. 
    
    I just created a new path on my drive: /scratch/plebld/208/rdbms/lib/. This is the exact same path referenced by the error message. Probably it would have been created during the full Oracle install or something, but it did not exist before. Then I placed a copy of the libclntsh.dylib.10.1 executable file there taken from \Library\Oracle\oracleclient folder that contained the latest unzipped version of Oracle client. And it worked.
    
    The new OCI8 combined with Ruby(i386) seems to be running much better and faster! Ruby running in PPC mode would often crash before and eating up lots of CPU. A+++++!
    
    Thanks a lot for all your work, Brent! Excellent and very helpful instructions!

    Hello:
    After reading your article about making vanilla extract at home using Jim Beam whiskey, I would like to point out that this method makes a wonderful infusion of vanilla flavored whiskey, and is perfectly acceptable for cooking, and other  home recipes. However, a true vanilla extract needs ethyl alcohol to really pull the flavors from the pods along with a slow maceration process in a solution of alcohol/water wash, that in time, will yield true vanilla extract that cannot be matched in taste by any other method. Whiskey imparts flavors to the vanilla, as does vodka, and really masks the true essence of real vanilla.

    These instructions were great!  I've been in a very poor mood today due to seemingly endless configuration and integration problems, and this is the first success I've had all day.
    
    Thanks ever so much for figuring out and posting this!

    You're right about this not being true vanilla extract.  I use this for baking and nothing else.  This is a slow maceration process, however: since the beans soak for 6 months to several years, and drinking alcohol is ethyl alcohol, you get the full flavor profile of the vanilla out of the beans.  You just can't tell exactly what it is because of the bourbon.  :)  I wouldn't use this for a high end vanilla custard, although for a more middling vanilla custard it's quite delicious.  Most of things I make seem to work better than with the more typical vanilla extract, just because of the added flavor complexity of the bourbon.
    
    If you wanted to do this yourself at home, it would be easy to obtain straight ethanol and do it with that instead: like that you'd have the <em>real</em> deal.

    First I am an Apple newby.
    I have OCI and Rails configured on an XP and now want to start developing on my new MacBook Pro.
    
    I followed your steps with some local help.
    
    1. I am sure I have instantclient installed correctly. It was tested with sql_plus and was able to access our DBs with TNANAMES
    
    2. I could not find the gem indicated in your instructions. I used the ...enhanced-adapter gem instead
    
    3. The compile seemed to go OK. I did not notice any errors
    
    4. The Test Connectivity step works just  fine
    
    5. the config.yml file had OCI as the adapter. I also tried Oracle
    
    6. I do not get any errors when I start the server - Mongrel from Aptana
    
    However when I try to hit the application from a browser I get a "Oracle/OCI libraries could not be loaded." error.
    
    I am unsure where the problem is and how to resolve it.
    Any help would greatly be appreciated.

    Hi, Brent. I tried the Jim Beam and vanilla beans, and it makes a woderful vanilla extract. I got to thinking, how high end is high end vanilla extract? We're certainly not drinking it, of course, and your method of making vanilla extract, I may never go back to the original stuff. You'
    re right about the complexity of flavors adding that extra dimension of flavor, and without that nasty harsh alcohol bite of the extract. True vanilla extract isn't really palatable and I think since the Jim Beam has aged, it just makes the vanilla all the better. Cheers to your good cooking!

    Alderete: Because the ActiveRecord Oracle adapter is namespaced to AR::ConnectionAdapters, if you were running in irb you couldn't just <code>require 'activerecord-oracle-adapter'</code> and have it work.  Instead, you would have to <code>require 'active_record/connection_adapters/oracle_adapter'</code>.  So, for the config line, you have to use:
    
    <code>config.gem 'activerecord-oracle-adapter', :lib => 'active_record/connection_adapters/oracle_adapter', :source => 'http://gems.rubyonrails.org'</code>
    
    The <code>:lib</code> option is necessary when the gem name & library name differ, as they do here.  I wish the docs for the config settings were a little bit better, but unfortunately that's where we are.

    In respond to LuciDreamer.
    You don't have to create a path like
    /scratch/plebld/208/rdbms/lib/.
    Just put the dylib's in $HOME/lib and netbeans
    (it's the dyld) will found everything.

    Thanks for this very concise primer, just what I was searching for. Made it very easy to set this up on 10.4.11
    A note: 
    The "Program" key seems to be at least unnecessary - in my version launchd even refuses to run the file on startup if it's present.
    I noticed you cannot chroot/chown a process if you start it with launchd - you have to set the owner in the plist file.
    
    You can start/stop lighttpd with launchd too: just type
    &gt; launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/
    to load the new plist files you put there, then start lighttpd with
    &gt; launchctl start net.lighttpd
    stop it with
    &gt; launchctl stop net.lighttpd
    same works with net.lighttpd_ssl of course 
    
    for reference here's my plist file minus the header:
    &lt;plist version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;net.lighttpd_ssl&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;array&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/sbin/lighttpd&lt;/string&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;-f/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd_ssl.conf&lt;/string&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;-D&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/array&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;UserName&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;www&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;GroupName&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;www&lt;/string&gt;

    Cute site, but have you thought about using CSS for the headings instead of Flash? They're not very accessible as is, and I know there are others who like me have Flash turned off. (By the way, your forms need a little more markup to be Triple-A Compliant.) 
    
    Best of luck with the site. I'll be visiting again. :)

    Here's a question: If I am on Rails 2.1, and I want to add the Oracle Adapter and ruby-oci8 as dependencies using the new gem dependency feature of 2.1, is it possible to do that?
    
    I've tried it using this line:
    
    <code>config.gem 'activerecord-oracle-adapter', :source =&gt; 'http://gems.rubyonrails.org'</code>
    
    But when I restart my development server, I get an error with a stack trace:
    
    =&gt; Booting Mongrel (use 'script/server webrick' to force WEBrick)
    =&gt; Rails 2.1.0 application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3001

    Any ideas?

    Hi,
    
    Great tutorial, it's exactly what I've been looking for.
    
    It seems I can get everything working except for being able to access the user folders, by this I mean http://localhost:3500/~Mic/ ... which just gives a 404 error. 
    
    All other requests work, including PHP on the standard doc root set in server.document-root ... just not when I try to get to the users folder.
    
    Any ideas !?
    
    I have bound the server to port 3500 just because I wanted to test against Apache, I will swop over eventually, but need to get this working first.
    
    Thanks

    Hey Brent,
    
    I'm desperate... is there a way to do this with Acrobat 5?
    
    Don't ask why I'm working in Acrobat 5... long, sad story...
    
    Thanks!
    Jackie

    I should add, I'm quite certain the gem is installed; I copied-and-pasted the name of the gem from the output of <code>gem list</code>.
    
    I get similar failure messages when I try to <code>rake gems:unpack</code> to automatically unpack gem dependencies, but I was successful doing a manual <code>gem unpack activerecord-oracle-adapter</code>. Of course, that didn't change the stack trace / errors when starting up my server....

    Mic,
    
    What is the exact code you used in <span class="code">lighttpd_shared.conf</span>?  To access <span class="code">http://yourserver/~Mic/</span> it should look like this:
    
    <pre class="code">userdir.basepath = "/Users/"
    userdir.path = "Sites"
    userdir.include-user = ("Mic") # only allow requests for this user (optional)
    </pre>
    
    The third line is optional, and allows you to whitelist users.  You can include as many users as you want, each with their own <span class="code">userdir.include-user</span> statement.  If you omit all of those statements, then access is allowed for all users.
    
    The other possibility is that you don't have a <span class="code">/Users/Mic/Sites/index.html</span> file, and so even though lighty is looking in the right place there is nothing for it to serve.
    
    Binding to port 3500 shouldn't make a difference, as long as the rest of the configuration is the same, so that's not the problem.
    
    Does this help?

    Oh, I'm so sorry! I wish I knew, but I haven't used Acrobat 5 in ... years.  Have you tried looking at the <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bbeda8b/" title="Wow &mdash; that's a bad URL" rel="nofollow">Adobe forums</a>?
    
    Good luck!

    Dear Brent,
    
    Congrats on your recent Botany POTD! (And thanks for stopping by.)
    
    Loved this post about live-in cactus. Here are some other examples of plant architecture. Hideous? Heavenly? You be the judge.

    Hi Brent,
    
    Thanks for that mate, you sorted it.
    
    For some reason I assumed userdir.include-user = ("username") was some sort of internal variable which picked up the current username. Doh !!
    
    All working now :-)
    
    Once again, fantastic tutorial mate ... I just need to figure out how to compile in the GD part of PHP and I've got an exact copy of my Apache setup, but instead using Lighttpd and including Rails, 5 star ... great stuff.
    
    Thanks again.
    
    Mic

  body: Many thanks to you.  I've been relying on your info for the past 12 months to use Rails and Oracle on OSX.  Recently, the Rosetta solution for Ruby became a big problem because mysql adapter doesn't like ppc bundle, and I needed both Oracle and Mysql together.  Now it's all fine.  Incidentally, where do you run your Oracle server - also on OSX ?  For now, mine is on a Linux VM also on my OSX.

    I did everything after cleaning up the previous PPC setup and it works in IRB mode. However when calling the OCI8 from NetBeans within the project, it gives the error:
    
    Oracle/OCI libraries could not be loaded: dlopen(/Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/universal-darwin9.0/oci8lib.bundle, 9): Library not loaded: /scratch/plebld/208/rdbms/lib/libclntsh.dylib.10.1

      Reason: image not found - /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/universal-darwin9.0/oci8lib.bundle
    
    Any possible suggestions?
    Thanks.

    Brent,
    
    Would love to hear what you think of the collection and installation inside the Branly. I thought the exterior was pretty wonderful but had many, many problems with the handling of the works inside. Maybe we would collaborate on a post about this....
    
    Good wishes,
    J.

    Thanks for the great sample config file! The best I found on Google...
    
    One thing about launchd: You probably have to run the command "sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.lighttpd.plist" for launchd to recognize the new plist file, though.
